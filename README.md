# elenakrittik's Scoop bucket

[![Tests](https://github.com/elenakrittik/bucket/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/elenakrittik/bucket/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Excavator](https://github.com/elenakrittik/bucket/actions/workflows/excavator.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/elenakrittik/bucket/actions/workflows/excavator.yml)

My personal [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) bucket. See [here](https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=%22https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Felenakrittik%2Fbucket%22&o=false)
for the list of applications included in this bucket.

## Usage

If you somehow found any of the included applications useful, run the following to add this bucket:

```pwsh
scoop bucket add elenakrittik https://github.com/elenakrittik/bucket
```

After that, use `scoop install <app>` as usual to install your desired app.

## How do I contribute new manifests?

Please don't :)
